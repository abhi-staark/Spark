### Key Features

- **Bloc Pattern:** We've implemented the Bloc pattern to manage the application's state effectively. This architectural approach helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to add new features and scale the app as needed.

- **Solid Principles:** Our app is built on a foundation of solid design principles, including Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion (SOLID). This ensures that our codebase is maintainable, scalable, and testable, making it easier to collaborate with other developers and extend the functionality of the app.

- **Edge Case Handling:** We've taken extra care to handle all potential edge cases meticulously. From input validation to error handling, our app is designed to provide a reliable and frustration-free user experience, ensuring that users can enjoy the app without encountering unexpected issues.
